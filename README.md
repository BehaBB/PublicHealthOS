# PublicHealthOS - AI-Driven Diabetes Management
**EB-2 NIW Strategic Initiative | National Healthcare Impact**

---

## National Significance (Prong 1)

### Addressing the $445B Diabetes Crisis
PublicHealthOS directly confronts the **national diabetes emergency** affecting **38 million Americans**, with projected **$200M annual healthcare savings** through AI-powered disease management.

**Immediate Impact Areas:**
- **Medi-Cal/Medicare Cost Reduction**: Targeting **$31B California burden**
- **Health Equity**: **40% focus on underserved communities**
- **Clinical Outcomes**: **1.0% A1C reduction** across **200,000 patients by 2028**
- **Emergency Care**: **45% reduction** in diabetes-related ER visits

> *This initiative addresses substantial merit and national importance through measurable public health and economic benefits.*
