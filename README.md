Scaling Strategy & National Deployment (Prong 3)
Phase 1: MVP Validation (Months 1–6)

Target: 2,500 patients
A1C Reduction: 0.8%
Key Deliverables: Functional AI engine, FDA eSTAR framework
Grant Submission: CDC SIP application

Phase 2: Clinical Expansion (Months 7–12)

Target: 10,000 patients
A1C Reduction: 0.9%
Key Deliverables: NIH SBIR Phase I, clinical validation
Job Creation: 5 technical positions in California

Phase 3: National Scale (2027–2028)

Target: 200,000 patients
A1C Reduction: 1.0%
Healthcare Savings: $200M annually
American Jobs: 12+ high-skill positions

Why Entrepreneurial Approach is Essential

Traditional employment would critically delay solution deployment.
This venture creates American jobs rather than fills existing positions.
