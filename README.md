## 🎯 National Significance (Prong 1)

### Addressing the $445B Diabetes Crisis
PublicHealthOS directly confronts the **national diabetes emergency** affecting 38 million Americans, with projected **$200M annual healthcare savings** through AI-powered disease management.

**Immediate Impact Areas:**
- **Medi-Cal/Medicare Cost Reduction**: Targeting $31B California burden
- **Health Equity**: 40% focus on underserved communities  
- **Clinical Outcomes**: 1.0% A1C reduction across 200,000 patients by 2028
- **Emergency Care**: 45% reduction in diabetes-related ER visits

### Value-Based Care Advantage
- **Shared Savings Model**: Direct Medicare/Medicaid cost reduction
- **Quality Metrics**: A1C improvement tied to CMS Star Ratings
- **Preventive Focus**: Reduces expensive complications (dialysis, amputations)
- **Regulatory Pathway**: FDA 510(k) alignment with predicate devices
